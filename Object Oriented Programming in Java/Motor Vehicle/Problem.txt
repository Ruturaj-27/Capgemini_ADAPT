MOTOR VEHICLE

DESCRIPTION :


The problem is related to identifying the correct driving for a particular vehicle i.e., if it is a two wheeler or four wheeler, vehicle should be driven accordingly. 

Your task here is to implement a Java code based on the following specifications. Note that your code should match the specifications in a precise manner. Consider default visibility of classes, data fields and methods are public unless mentioned otherwise.

Specification: 

abstract class MotorVehicle {
public String driveStatus; 
public abstract String driveVehicle();
getters/Setters... 
} 

class TwoWheeler extends MotorVehicle {
@Override
public String driveVehicle(){};
}

class FourWheeler extends MotorVehicle {
@Override public String driveVehicle(){};
}

Task :

class MotorVehicle:

-driveStatus: This property should be set "Preparing for drive" when object is instantiated.

class TwoWheeler:

-String driveVehicle() : Returns "You are driving two wheeler".

Sample Input:

var twoWheeler = new TwoWheeler(); 
System.out.println(twoWheeler.DriveStatus);
var twoWheelerDrive = twoWheeler.DriveVehicle(); 
System.out.println(twoWheelerDrive);
 var fourWheeler = new FourWheeler(); 
System.out.println(fourWheeler.DriveStatus); 
var fourWheelerDrive = fourWheeler.DriveVehicle();
 System.out.println(fourWheelerDrive); 

Sample Output:

Preparing for drive
You are driving two wheeler 
Preparing for drive 
You are driving four wheeler
 
Note: 
-You can make suitable function calls and use the RUN 
CODE button to check your main() method output.
