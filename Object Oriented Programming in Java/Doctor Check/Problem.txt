DOCTOR CHECK 

DESCRIPTION :

A Doctor record has the doctorâ€™s specialty (such as "Pediatrician", "Obstetrician", "General Practitioner", and so forth; so use the type String) and office visit fee (use type double ). Be sure your class has a reasonable complement of constructors, accessor, and mutator methods, and suitably defined equals() and toString() methods. Write a program to test all your methods.


DoctorSalary class defines Doctor's salary. Define the accessor and mutator to obtain the Doctor pay. Doctor inherits DoctorSalary.


Note: The stub code is already present in the coding editor, the participant needs to

implement the logic for equals() method and toString() to Check the Doctor's

Object w.r.t to specialty and fees.

Doctor doc1 = new Doctor("Obstetrician", 500, 2250.3);

Sample Input : 

Doctor doc2 = new Doctor();
doc2.setFee(500);
doc2.setSalary(2250.3);
doc2.setSpecial("Obstetrician");
