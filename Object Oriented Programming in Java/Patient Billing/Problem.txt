PatientBillingSystem

DESCRIPTION

Give the definition of two classes, Patient and Billing, whose objects are records for a clinic.

Patient will be derived from the class Person.

Doctor's information is derived from Doctor class.

A Patient record has the patient's name (inherited from the class Person) and primary physician of type Doctor. A Billing object will contain a Patient object, a Doctor object, and an amount due of type double.

Be sure your classes have a reasonable complement of constructors, accessor, and mutator methods, and suitably defined equals and toString methods. write a program to test all your methods, then write a test program that creates at least two patients. at least two doctors, and at least two Billing records, and then prints out the total income from the Billing records.

Sample Input:

Doctor doctor 1 = new Doctor ("Peter Mark", new Date(4, 30, 1995),75000, "General Physician", 85);
Doctor doctor2 = new Doctor("Josh Samuel", new Date(2, 12, 1990). 88000, "Orthopedic Doctor", 190);

Patient patient1 = new Patient("Sam Peter", doctor 1);
Patient patient2 = new Patient("Rob Mehar", doctor 2);

Billing billing 1 = new Billing(patient1, doctor 1, doctor1.getfees()); 
Billing billing2 = new Billing(patient2, doctor 1, doctor1.getfees());

System.out.println("Record 1:");
System.out.println(billing 1);
System.out.println("Record 2:");
System.out.println(billing2);
System.out.println("Total due amount: Rs" + (billing 1.getAmount() + billing.getAmount()));
