SHAPE HIERARCHY

DESCRIPTION :

Create an interface named Shape in file with the following abstract methods

-getArea() : double ( return type is double)
-getPerimeter() : double

Create an abstract class named AbstractShape which implements  
Shape interface with the below private instance variable

colour:String

-create parameterized constructor
-Override toString() method to return String as per below format

colour=X

where X represents value of colour variable

Create a concrete subclass of AbstractShape named Rectangle with the below private instance variables

length:int
breadth:int

-create constructor with 3 parameters to initialize colour, length and breadth properties of Rectangle in the given sequence

-implement the inherited methods getArea and getPerimeter using appropriate formulas for Rectangle[Refer Hints Section]

-Override toString to return String as per below format

Rectangle [colour=X, length=X, breadth=X]

where X represent respective values of variables

Create another concrete subclass of AbstractShape named Circle with the below private instance variable

radius:int

-create constructor with 2 parameters to initialize colour and radius properties of Circle in the given sequence

-implement the inherited methods getArea and getPerimeter using appropriate formulas for Circle[Refer Hints Section]

-Override toString to return String as per below format

Circle [colour=X, radius=X]

where X represent respective values of variables

In the class Source, do the following

Create a static method named printShape which should able to take any shape object as parameter. This method
should display the area and perimeter of the input shape object in the below format.
 
Area: X,Perimeter: X

where X represent the respective values.cThe area and perimeter should be rounded to the nearest integer and displayed
 
In the main method, do the following

-Accept first input as CIRCLE or RECTANGLE.
-If first input is CIRCLE, Accept colour and radius
-If first input is RECTANGLE, Accept colour, length and breadth.
-Create object of Circle or Rectangle based on first input and print the details of object.
-Call printShape to print the Area and Perimeter.

Note: Use Console to accept input

Refer Example section for Input and output format

Example
Sample Input:

CIRCLE
RED 5

Expected Output:

Circle [colour=RED, radius=5]
Area: 79,Perimeter: 31
Sample Input:
RECTANGLE
GREEN 10 5

Expected Output:
Rectangle [colour=GREEN, length=10, breadth=5]
Area: 50,Perimeter: 30

Hints/Tips
Circle Formulas

Area 		: Pi x r x r
Perimeter	: 2 x Pi x r

Rectangle Formulas
Area 		: l x b
Perimeter 	: 2 x (l+b)

-Use static variable PI of Math class
-Use Math.round(..) for rounding a double to nearest integer. Rounding should be done in printShape method
