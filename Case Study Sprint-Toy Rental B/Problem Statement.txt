In 2009, Mr. Harry Peter, founded a Baby Toy Company LLP, in United States, its headquarters in Los Angeles, CA. The company was selling premium toys, but the business had been stagnant over the years. Harry Peter was looking at bringing in new offerings to increase revenue. A survey was conducted on kids and their preference for toys and it was found that attention span/engagement with a new toy lasts only few days for kids and they start demanding a new one within a week. However, the survey also brought out that parents found affording premium toys difficult. Like any businessman, Harry Peter saw an opportunity here and decided to launch a new offering of premium toys being available on rent. He directed his IT team to make rental option for customers available on their online portal http://baby-toy-company.xyz
